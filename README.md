# random-good-sign-off

Browser extension that inserts a sign-off message randomly chosen from https://www.are.na/meg-miller/good-sign-offs to your gmail editor.

The Good Sign-Offs Are.na channel maintained by Meg Miller and Hannah Barbera contains numerous sign-off messages, ranging from conventional to witty. This extension queries the Are.na API for a random message in this channel, then inserts the message to your cursor's position in your Gmail editor.

It will take a couple seconds until a message is retrieved. Currently does not work anywhere else than Gmail. Largely experimental work as of yet.
